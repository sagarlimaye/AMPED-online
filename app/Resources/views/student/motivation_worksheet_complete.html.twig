      <h4>What is motivation?</h4>
      <p>Motivation is the desire or willingness to do something. The following chart outlines examples of activities that happen because of motivation.</p>

       <h4>Increasing motivation</h4>
       <p>There are several steps you can take to increase your motivation. First, you must identify if you want to increase your motivation by changing your (1) emotions, (2) thoughts, or (3) actions. Which one do you think would be easiest to change? </p>
       <p>Thoughts and actions are the easiest to change. Feelings are hard to change, but when you change thoughts and actions, your feelings might change as well.</p>
       <h4>Controlling your Actions</h4>
       <p>First let’s go over how to control your actions so you increase your motivation to do something. One of the most effective actions you can take is giving yourself a reward. This works really well for things you are not interested in doing or things you find challenging.</p>
       <p style="font-weight: bold">Examples of rewards</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
        <li>Doing an activity that you enjoy</li>
        <li>Watching your favorite TV show</li>
        <li>taking a snack break</li>
       </ul>
       <h4>Controlling your thoughts</h4>
       <p>Now let’s talk about how you can control your thoughts. First think about the goal that you want to accomplish. This could be completing your homework, for example. Then, think about how accomplishing that goal will be beneficial to you in the future. For example, instead of thinking that doing your homework is boring, think about how doing your homework will give you more practice and help you perform well on your next test.</p>
       <p style="font-weight: bold">Questions to ask?</p>
       <ul>
        <li>What goal should I accomplish?</li>
        <li>How will accomplishing this goal help me in the future?</li>
       </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        {{form_start(form) }}
       <p>Where are the three places motivation starts? ** Mention the two that are the easiest to control. **</p>
       <ol>
        <li>{{ answers.motivation_place_1 }}</li>
        <li>{{ answers.motivation_place_2 }}</li>
        <li>{{ answers.motivation_place_3 }}</li>

       <h4>Motivation Chart</h4>
       <p>In the following chart, think of some activities that may require motivation to complete. Think
about where you can change your motivation (e.g. in your thoughts, emotions, or actions). Then,
write down what you will change about your thoughts, emotions, or actions that will increase your
motivation. An example is provided.</p>
