          <p>Have you ever noticed that certain activities affect how you feel? For example, if you hang out with your friends and have a fun time, you feel happy. If you play on a sports team and score a goal, you feel proud. In this module, G.P.A. stands for “Goal for Positive Activities.” You will learn types of positive activities, and you will make goals to increase the amount of positive activities you participate in each day.</p>
          <h4>Types of Positive activities</h4>
          <ol>
            <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Interactions </span> are activities that allow you to interact with other people in a positive way. </p>
            <p>Examples: hanging out with friends; spending time with your family</p></li>

            <li> <p><span style="font-weight: bold">Achievements </span> are activities that make you feel as though you accomplished a goal or skill. </p>
            <p>Examples: completing a homework assignment; baking a cake</p></li>
          </ol>

             <h4>Mood and Positive Activities</h4>
             <p>If we participate in many positive activities during the day, our mood will be more positive. The more we participate in positive activities, the better we feel. Some positive feelings we experience include happiness, pride, hope, excitement, motivation, satisfaction, joyful, optimism, peace, and encouragement. Think about the positive activities you listed above. What positive mood or feeling will result from participating in those activities? In the chart, write the positive mood next to the activity.</p>
             <h4>Increasing Positive Activities</h4>
             <p>Think about how many times you participated in these activities yesterday. Was the number low?
             Increasing the amount of positive activities will improve your mood. On the next page, you will be able to set a goal for how many positive activities you will strive to complete every day.</p>

             <h4>Agenda Example</h4> 
             <p>Over the next few weeks, record how many activities you complete each day in your agenda. Strive to participate in your goal number of activities at least 4 times each week. You can create a checkbox next to your GPA count to see if you met the GPA Goal for the day. An example is provided below.</p>
